## Data Composition

### Sequences & Frames
- 100 sequences, each containing 100 frames (10 seconds at 10 Hz)
- Total: 10,000 frames across diverse driving scenarios

### Storage Formats
- **Point Clouds**: Raw and ego-motion compensated as compressed NumPy arrays
- **Images**: JPEG sequences (4K resolution)
- **Annotations**: Bounding boxes and semantic point classes as JSON metadata with calibration and ego-pose information

### Synchronization
- All sensors synchronized using **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)**
- All LiDARs are frame synchronized (start-of-scan) at 10 Hz

## Annotations

### 3D Bounding Boxes
- 3D object annotations in LiDAR coordinate space
- Object type labels (25 semantic classes)
- Tracking IDs and per-object velocity vectors

### Semantic Segmentation
- Per-point semantic labels for all 6 LiDARs
- 25 semantic classes including vehicles, pedestrians, road infrastructure

### Semantic Classes
```
Vehicles: car, bus, truck, trailer, vehicle_on_rails, other_vehicle
Persons: pedestrian, motorcyclist, bicyclist
Objects: bicycle, motorcycle, animal, traffic_item, traffic_sign
Structures: pole_trunk, building, other_structure, vegetation
Surfaces: road, lane_boundary, road_marking, reflective_markers, sidewalk, other_ground
```

## Calibration & Poses

### Camera Intrinsics
- Focal length, principal point, and distortion coefficients for each camera

### Sensor Extrinsics
- All LiDARs and cameras extrinsically calibrated with respect to the ego-vehicle frame (center of rear-axle)

### Vehicle Poses
- LiDAR-inertial odometry used to estimate 6-DoF pose for each frame
